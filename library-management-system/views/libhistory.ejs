        <h1>OldTown Library History</h1>
        <h2>Discover the Legacy of Knowledge</h2>
        
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>The OldTown Library has been a beacon of knowledge and community since its establishment in 1892. Over the years, it has evolved to meet the changing needs of its patrons while preserving its rich heritage.</p>
            <p>From its humble beginnings as a small collection of books, the library has grown into a modern facility offering a wide range of resources, including digital media, community programs, and educational workshops.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>1. The Foundation: The "New Year's Charter" (1892)</h3>
            <p>On the morning of January 1, 1892, the steel tycoon Elias Thorne dedicated his fortune to build a "Cathedral of Logic" in the heart of Old Town.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> It was the first library in the region to use a mechanical card catalog system, a precursor to the databases we use today. It symbolized the shift from private collections to public knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>The Architecture:</strong> Built with local iron and red brick, the library featured a massive "Clock of Centuries" in the lobby that was synchronized with the library’s internal filing system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>2. The Great Depression & The "Labor Exchange" (1929-1939)</h3>
            <p>When the stock market crashed, the Old Town Lexicon became more than a library; it became a survival hub.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Aspect:</strong> The library became the unofficial "Town Hall." Because it was a neutral space, labor unions and factory owners met in the "Silent Wings" to negotiate strikes. It was the only place in Old Town where a penniless worker and a wealthy landlord sat at the same table.</li>
                <li><strong>War Time Moment (WWI):</strong> During the tail end of the Great War, the basement was converted into a Telegraphy School, training local residents in Morse code to help with wartime communications.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>3. The 1944 "Paper Blockade" (WWII)</h3>
            <p>During World War II, Old Town was a strategic rail hub. The library faced its greatest threat when a regional paper shortage led the government to suggest "recycling" old books for the war effort.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Resistance:</strong> The head librarian, Clara Vance, hid the most valuable 19th-century collections in the hollowed-out walls of the ventilation shafts. She famously told the military, "You can take the iron from our fences, but you will not take the wisdom from our shelves."</li>
                <li><strong>Political Aspect:</strong> The library functioned as a Sanctuary Zone. It was declared a "Non-Combatant Landmark," allowing refugees passing through Old Town to sleep in the reading rooms.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>4. The 1990s: The "Silicon Shift"</h3>
            <p>As the digital age dawned, the library faced an identity crisis. The town debated tearing it down to build a shopping center.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Aspect:</strong> A grassroots movement called "The Save-the-Lexicon Campaign" fought a 3-year legal battle. They won by proving the library held the original land deeds of every house in Old Town, making it legally indispensable to the city’s existence.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> This period saw the first server racks installed in the old "Poetry Section," marking the beginning of the Digital Archive.</li>
            </ul>
